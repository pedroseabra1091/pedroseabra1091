## 🔖 Elixir training repositories
I remember the time where I wasn't affected with this curse but all was set to change once I tried Elixir…
Bound towards the cleanest code, I just knew I had to spread all the things I learned! With the help of Deemaze Software, a 5 session training was organized where I lectured a vast set of Elixir related topics. Here are some the repositories that I used on the sessions:
